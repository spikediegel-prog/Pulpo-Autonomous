# Independent Authority Service Proof

Status date: 2026-08-26

## Claim classification

- **Verified:** Pulpo's worker package exposes only typed request and poll
  operations to the authority service.
- **Verified:** the separately packaged reference recomputes the displayed
  intent hash, constructs service-owned approval metadata, binds a WebAuthn
  challenge to the exact signing payload, requires user presence and
  verification, rejects backup-eligible and recovery credentials, checks its
  signer against pinned trust, writes complete evidence before releasing an
  envelope, and allows one exact envelope through the canonical kernel.
- **Verified:** HTTP tests exercise request, the escaped human review page,
  challenge, assertion, poll, malformed input, unknown request, strict browser
  response headers, completed-request button disabling, and field-substitution
  behavior.
- **Recorded:** the service uses `webauthn==3.0.0` for server-side assertion
  validation and separately pins its HTTP/runtime dependencies.
- **Blocked:** production deployment, independent administration, real hardware
  enrollment, non-exportable service signing, durable monotonic state,
  append-only evidence, worker ingress isolation, and external reproduction.

## Package boundary

`pulpo/authority_client.py` is part of the governed worker package. Its public
interface contains exactly `request_approval` and `poll_approval`. It rejects
non-HTTPS service origins and cross-origin human approval URLs.

`authority-service/` is a separate Python distribution. It is not discovered or
installed by the root Pulpo package. It contains no enrollment, rotation,
recovery, revocation, raw-sign, private-key export, or trust-configuration API.
Its signer and state/evidence implementations are injected at the independent
service boundary.

## Exact successful proof

The acceptance test constructs one immutable intent request, derives the exact
challenge, supplies a simulated fresh hardware assertion, writes the full
evidence bundle, signs `pulpo.approval.v2` with an ephemeral test-only Ed25519
fixture, polls the resulting envelope, and passes it to the canonical Pulpo
kernel. The kernel verifies pinned public trust and produces one bound permit.
A second service approval and a second permit consumption are denied.

Ephemeral test private keys are test fixtures only. They are not deployment
keys, credentials, repository secrets, or evidence of independent custody.

## Adversarial proof

The tests fail closed for:

- display fields that disagree with the Pulpo intent hash;
- deployment substitution or excessive TTL;
- HTTP fields outside the exact request schema;
- cross-origin human approval URLs;
- authority-service HTTP redirects and oversized responses;
- credential enumeration or unauthenticated human-denial routes;
- recovery credentials used for ordinary approval;
- unverified, backup-eligible, backed-up, inactive, or unapproved credentials;
- authenticator counter rollback;
- a service signer that does not match pinned Pulpo trust;
- evidence-store failure;
- duplicate ceremony completion;
- invalid RP/origin configuration; and
- unknown authority requests.

The human button is executable reference code, not proof of a real hardware
ceremony. No real browser, approved authenticator, enrolled credential,
production RP ID/origin, or deployed service participated in the repository
tests. WebAuthn requires user verification but does not report the local
verification modality to the relying party. Touch ID, Face ID, and phone
confirmation therefore remain **Not Tested** and are not claimed.

## Production acceptance gate

Production remains **Blocked** until one exact environment supplies and proves:

1. a permanent RP ID and exact HTTPS origin;
2. an independently administered service account unreachable by the worker;
3. approved primary and offline recovery hardware models and their physical
   enrollment ceremony;
4. a non-exportable Ed25519-compatible service signer whose public fingerprint
   is pinned by Pulpo policy;
5. durable transactional request, credential, sequence, revocation, and replay
   state with rollback detection;
6. independently append-only full assertion/signature evidence;
7. worker ingress restricted to a non-human request/poll identity; and
8. an externally reproduced success plus origin, RP, challenge, credential,
   UV, backup, replay, rollback, expiry, signer, and evidence-failure tests.

Until all eight pass at the exact deployed version, the correct public claim is
**executable independent-authority reference**, not deployed independent human
authority.
